operator is nothing but performing specific operation between operands.
Example:
a + b

a,b are the operands
+ operator

Operators are three types
1.Unary OPerator
2.Binary OPerator
3.Ternary OPerator

1.Arithmetic 
	+    - use for addition
	-    - use for substraction
	*    - use for multiplicatio
	/    - use for to get co-efficent with fraction
	//   - use for to get co-efficent decimal
	%   - use for to get reminder

	i/p1  operator    i/p2     res
	 5        +         2       7 
	 5        -         2       3
	 5        *         2       10
	 5        /         2       2.5
	 5        //        2       2
	 5        %         2       1
2.Relational
	<	- less than
	>	- greater than
	<=	- less than equal to
	>=	- greater than equal to
	!=	- not equal to
	==	- equal to equal to

	i/p1  operator    i/p2     res
	 5        <         2       F
	 5        >         2       T
	 5        <=        2       F
	 5        >=        2       T
	 5        !=        2       T
	 5        ==        2       F


3.Logical operator
	and
	or 
	not

	Truth Table
	i/p1	i/p2	and o/p		or o/p		not o/p
         F	F	F		F		T	
         F	T	F		T		T
         T	F	F		T		F
         T	T	T		T		F

	i/p1  operator    i/p2     res
	 0        and       2       F
	 5        or        2       T
	 5        not       -       F

4.Assignment
Assignment operator is used to assign the data to the variables
Note:
	Always should be a L.H.S variable only present to Assignment Operator
	R.H.S it might be a variable or value to Assignment Operator
Ex:
a=10
b=20
c=a
10=a ---> wrong
Short hand Assignment OPerator:
	a=a+b    ---> a+=b
	c=c-a	 ---> c-=a
	d=d*r	 ---> d*=r
	f=f/c	 ---> f/=c
	g=g%k	 ---> g%=k
5.Identity 
In identity two types of opeartors are avilable
	1.is
	2.is not
6.Membership
	1.in
	2.not in
